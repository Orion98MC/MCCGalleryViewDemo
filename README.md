This project will hopefully help you figure how easy it is to integrate this gallery in your view controller.

Open in XCode, Build, Run, smile :)


## Pictures

The pictures of this demo are all 1440 Ã— 960 pixels in jpg format. It's a pretty big resolution for an iphone but still it loads pretty quickly due to the forced background decompression used. 

You may read a bit on the subject on my blog: http://orion98mc.blogspot.com/2012/08/on-ios-uiimage-decompression-nightmare.html

All the pictures are meant for the purpose of this demo and are licensed under the same license as this software. For those interested, I have taken them in the streets of Monaco. If you like them or would like to use one of them, please let me know.
